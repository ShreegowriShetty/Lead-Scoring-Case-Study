## Overview:
X Education is an education company that offers online courses to industry professionals. The company drives traffic to its website through various marketing channels, including search engines and other platforms. Visitors to the site may browse courses, complete inquiry forms, or watch videos. When a visitor provides their contact details, they are categorized as a lead. Additionally, X Education receives leads through referrals.
Once leads are gathered, the sales team follows up via calls and emails. However, the current conversion rate is around 30%, meaning that out of 100 leads, only approximately 30 convert into actual sales. To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify 'Hot Leads'—those most likely to convert—so that the sales team can focus their efforts on these high-potential leads.

## Solution:
We propose building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. This score will help prioritize leads, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of conversion. This approach is expected to increase the overall lead conversion rate by allowing the sales team to concentrate on the most promising leads.
